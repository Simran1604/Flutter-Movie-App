# Flutter-Movie-App

The movie app has a list of movies with its details. It directs the user to the Wikipedia page of the movie and the YouTube page of its trailer on clicking the respective "More" and "Play" buttons.
The app is now updated with better UI.
Hero for animated transition and GestureDetector and InkWell for accessing links have been deployed.

Here is an attached video to show the working of the app.
